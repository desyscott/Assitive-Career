A web developer’s canvas is a user’s web browser.Much like how a curious child takes pleasure in making toys by joining LEGO blocks—and then experiences a similar joy in taking things apart to see how they’re made, a web developer’s job is to use the basic building blocks of the web (like HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to create something complex like a webpage. Don’t sweat it! We’ll get into all of those terms soon.It is also the web developer’s job to diagnose problems in a website’s functionality, to understand how something works by reading the code behind it, and to make changes to fix any issues. That essentially makes web developers the physicians of the world wide web."

In reality, robots are incredibly smart machines that aid individuals and organizations in problem-solving every day. Those solutions might be as impactful as the Packbots used to inspect damage at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in 2011 — or as mundane as a Roomba cleaning up the cat hair on your rug so you don’t have to. For these inventions and many more, we have robotics engineers to thank.Robotics engineering is a growing field that entails a combination of data analysis, engineering, and computer science. People working in these fields use software and mechanical hardware to design, build, and test robots and their related machine-based processes.That said, each robotics engineering job is unique, and the practicalities of a job in this field often depend on the person’s background. While robotics engineers with coding backgrounds tend to focus more on the software side of things, those with mechanical engineering backgrounds lean toward the physical components of a robot."

They create software, applications, and scalable web services, while also providing leadership for coding teams. Full-stack engineers usually possess prodigious skills and are involved in each stage of software development. This can include data structure completion, architecture design, code review, performance evaluation, internal tool management, and updates. The term “full-stack” refers to the engineer’s ability to work on both the front-end and back-end development of an application.At the beginning of a project, full-stack engineers may meet with members of the software development team in order to lay out the scale and scope of the software project. After that, they will begin designing and building the software. Full-stack engineers write various high-level and low-level code. They troubleshoot errors, help design the user experience (UX), resolve bugs, and improve the overall efficiency of the software. Full-stack engineers need excellent collaboration skills because they work with front- and back-end development team members"
